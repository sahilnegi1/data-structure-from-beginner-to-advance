## Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in computer science. They form the foundation for algorithms and play a crucial role in designing efficient software systems.

## Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures. They consist of a collection of elements, each identified by an index.

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are inserted and removed from the same end.

## Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

## Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. They are widely used for representing hierarchical relationships.

## Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. They are used to represent networks and relationships between objects.

## Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array where the desired value can be found.

## Advanced Data Structures

Explore advanced data structures such as AVL trees, B-trees, heap, trie, and more to deepen your understanding of data organization and manipulation.
